## Project Description
This project is an API with a database. There you have memberadministration, activity and signups.<br/>
First you need to setup the database, to do that run the MySQL script inside: SetupDatabase.sql <br/>
There is basic authentication which needs the person to login with their ID and password. <br/>
You first make an account, then login to have full access to the different controllers.<br/>
Swagger is built into the project so i recommend using that.<br/>
